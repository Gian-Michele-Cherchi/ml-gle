### Tentative Project for sharing and exploring new ideas to be applied to Molecular Dynamics Generation from short-term trajectories

### DATASET

The dataset repo is at https://huggingface.co/datasets/gian-michele/meltBR. 

It contains some additional information and you can access it by creating an account at https://huggingface.co, if you do not already have it. It is a private repo, so only people with credentials can access. 

Once you have created your account tell me your username so I  can add you as contributor: you will have to create a token from your account once you created it. This will allow you to clone repos. 

In order to download or upload anything on huggingface you will have to download the git Large File System library, but you will find a little tutorial on how to do it once you register to the site. 

Once you cloned the project on your local machine or host you work on, you can download goind in the data folder by, 
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/gian-michele/meltBR
```
It will ask your hugginface credentials and your token probably.
